# What's New in the Sustainability Tool

### User  Release  Note:  22nd September  2025

### General Updates (Applicable to User Roles - All)

We've made several updates to improve navigation, usability, and clarity across the platform. Here's what's new and improved:

- **Sidebar Performance Improvements:** The sidebar has been optimised to load faster, even for accounts with a large number of projects, business units, and reporting packages.

- **Sidebar Independent Scroll:** The sidebar now scrolls independently and remembers your position, so you don’t have to scroll back to find your place after clicking on any level.

- **Search Bar in Sidebar:** Quickly search for Business Units, Projects, and Reporting Packages directly from the sidebar; no need to navigate back to the notifications page.

- **Improved Hover Error Message Display:** Error tooltips in logs have been repositioned, so they no longer block the cell you’re trying to edit, making it easier to correct errors.

- **Expand/Collapse at Project Level:** You can now expand or collapse Reporting Packages directly from the Project level to see all reporting packages without clicking into each project individually.

- **Updated Error Page Messaging:** The error page now provides clear instructions and our support email, so you know exactly what to do if something goes wrong.

- **Export Page Updates:** Exports now display a progress message, so you know they’re running, and the "N+" values on the Export Report Timeliness export are clearly explained.

- **Reporting Package Name Display Fix:** Fixed an issue where some Reporting Packages intermittently showed as “Reporting package” instead of their correct name.

### General Updates (Applicable to User Roles - Viewer)

- **Viewer Access to All Report Statuses:** Viewers can now see all reports in the Historic Reports page — still read-only to protect data integrity.
