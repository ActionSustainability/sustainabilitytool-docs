What's New in the Sustainability Tool
=====================================

User  Release  Note:  3^rd^ October  2025

General Updates (Applicable to User Roles - All)

We've made several updates to improve navigation, usability, and clarity across the platform. Here's what's new and improved:

- **Tabbed Notifications Page: **The Notifications page is now organised into tabs, making it easier to switch between pending actions, dashboards, and outstanding invites in one place.

- **Fix for Pending Actions Visibility: **Resolved an issue with displaying pending actions in the My pending actions table. Now all relevant statuses display correctly without needing to tick "Include Approved Reports."

General Updates (Applicable to User Roles - Admin)

**- ****Toggle Between Cumulative and Periodic Values: **Added a toggle switch in ESG Tracker dashboards under Performance Breakdown. Users can now choose whether to view cumulative or periodic values as the primary displayed number.

- **Improved Report Timeliness Export Guidance: **Enhanced the explanation for CSV exports of report timeliness. Users can now clearly understand overdue, on-time, early, and not-yet-submitted report values.

- **New User Management Experience: **Introduced a redesigned user management system with an "All Levels" vs "This Level & Below" toggle, and detailed single-user views. Authority groups are hidden (except for super admins), and outstanding invitations are now in a separate tab.

General Updates (Applicable to User Roles - Viewer)

- **Clearer Permissions Message for Viewers: **Updated the message shown to Viewer users at reporting package level. The new wording provides clear guidance on how to view dashboards and historic reports instead of attempting to edit or submit reports.
