# What’s New in the Sustainability Tool

### User Release Note: July 2025

We’ve introduced several updates to improve reports, navigation, file uploads and data analysis. Here’s a summary of what’s changed. Each change is accompanied by an example of screenshot (please note these are test screens and not real data)

### Reporting Process Improvements - (Applicable to User Roles - All)

- **Comments History:** comments made by reporters and approvers on each tab are now shown in chronological order, improving clarity of discussions.

- **New Approval Status(s):** tabs in packages marked “pending approval” can now be labelled as ‘Accepted’, ‘Unreviewed’ or ‘Requires Revision’. This makes it easier to understand what needs attention before overall approval.

### Data Submission - (Applicable to User Roles – Data Reporters)

- **Report Submission Final Confirmation:** before submitting a report, users now see a read-only summary showing:

i.	All report details

ii.	All inputs values and evidence documentation

iii.	Any data entries that may need review (these are automatically flagged by the system based on potential user input errors)

Users are not required to change any data, but the system will prompt them to double-check flagged entries for accuracy.

**To submit the report, users must add a short comment in the final confirmation view.** This helps provide context or notes for approvers, ensuring transparency at the point of submission.

- **Simpler File Uploads:** users can now drag and drop files directly into the platform when uploading evidence of documentation. Allows multiple files and different types of files (e.g. .doc, .pdf, jpg etc.)

- **Improved Data Submission  Process:** the interface for log uploads has been updated to simplify the experience for reporters.

**Step 1:** reporters can select whether they wish to enter data manually or select a log upload. Reporters opting to enter data manually are directed straight to step 4.

**Step 2:** users who select the log upload are prompted to download the template Excel file. Once the template is complete, save the sheet as .CSV

**Step 3:** users are prompted to upload their completed file as a CSV

**Step 4:** users can enter and edit data in the table interface. The system checks for gaps in required fields and formatting to ensure valid entries (e.g. data in the correct formats such as numeric, dates, or dropdown options etc.).

**Please Note:**
