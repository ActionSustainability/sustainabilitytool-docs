# What’s New in the Sustainability Tool

### User Release Note: July 2025

We’ve introduced several updates to improve reports, navigation, file uploads and data analysis. Here’s a summary of what’s changed. Each change is accompanied by an example of screenshot (please note these are test screens and not real data)

### Reporting Process Improvements - (Applicable to User Roles - All)

- **Comments History:** comments made by reporters and approvers on each tab are now shown in chronological order, improving clarity of discussions.

- **New Approval Status(s):** tabs in packages marked “pending approval” can now be labelled as ‘Accepted’, ‘Unreviewed’ or ‘Requires Revision’. This makes it easier to understand what needs attention before overall approval.
(Applicable to User Roles – Acceptors, Approvers)

### Data Submission - (Applicable to User Roles – Data Reporters)

- **Report Submission Final Confirmation:** before submitting a report, users now see a read-only summary showing:

i.	All report details

ii.	All inputs values and evidence documentation

iii.	Any data entries that may need review (these are automatically flagged by the system based on potential user input errors)

Users are not required to change any data, but the system will prompt them to double-check flagged entries for accuracy.

To submit the report, users must add a short comment in the final confirmation view. This helps provide context or notes for approvers, ensuring transparency at the point of submission.

- **Simpler File Uploads:** users can now drag and drop files directly into the platform when uploading evidence of documentation. Allows multiple files and different types of files (e.g. .doc, .pdf, jpg etc.)
 
-	**Easier File Review:** click on the number of uploaded files to see a full list. Files can be deleted using the bin icon.

- **Improved Data Submission  Process:** the interface for log uploads has been updated to simplify the experience for reporters.

Step 1: reporters can select whether they wish to enter data manually or select a log upload. Reporters opting to enter data manually are directed straight to step 4. 

Step 2: users who select the log upload are prompted to download the template Excel file. Once the template is complete, save the sheet as .CSV

Step 3: users are prompted to upload their completed file as a CSV
 
Step 4: users can enter and edit data in the table interface. The system checks for gaps in required fields and formatting to ensure valid entries (e.g. data in the correct formats such as numeric, dates, or dropdown options etc.).

Please Note:
-	Any blank rows are removed when saved
-	As soon as one field is interacted with in a row the required fields in that row are highlighted clearly to the user

### Dashboard Improvements & Features for Data Analysis 
 
### (Applicable to User Roles – All)

- **New Layout: business unit dashboards now have three tabs:**

i.	Performance Breakdown: indicator data and charts

ii.	Reporting Analysis: overview of reporting statuses

iii.	Exports: access to data downloads in XLS, CSV and ZIP
 
-	**Approved Data Only:** all downloads now include only approved data, ensuring accuracy in exported reports.

-	**Indicator Status Chart:** a doughnut chart shows how indicators are performing (the number achieving target, at risk, failing, or no target set).

-	**Reports Approved Summary:** displays how up-to-date a dashboard is by comparing approved reports to expected submissions.  

-	**Filter Toggle:** a new button lets users show or hide filters to adjust the data displayed
 

- **Topic-level Insights:**

i.	See all topics, number of indicators and their status

ii.	Click a topic to view all its indicators and values

iii.	Click an indicator for detailed charts and performance breakdown

-	**Indicator Chart View:** select topic and indicator to see values over time, percentage change since the last reporting period, and options to view the data as pie, stacked bar, simple bar or line charts. Click the arrows along the bottom to load historical data.
 
- **Indicator Comparison:** this component allows users to select multiple indicators and compare them over time in a single chart

Users may click on the blue “+ Indicators” button to select indicators to add to this chart. Once the indicators have been selected, users may click “Done” to close the indicator selection.

-	**Simple Indicator Component:** displays selected components performance. Users may select which topic and indicator to display here.
 
### Other Changes (Applicable to User Roles – Admin)

- **API Link and User Guide Removed:** from the help dropdown menu. Information regarding the API and User Guide will be reinstated at a later date and in relevant sections of the platform.
 
-	**Expanded Package Visibility:** all reporting packages a user has access to are now listed under the “Dashboards and reports” table in each user’s profile page, accessible when logging in and via the bell notification icon in the top menu. Previously only reporting packages with pending actions were visible. This improves navigation.
