# General guidance

## How to get started

Users will receive an email inviting them to join a company account on the Sustainability Tool. They should follow the simple steps outlined in the email, which includes opening a web link (https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/accounts/register/), entering their contact details and then creating a password.

Once registered, users are able to access their account by going to https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/, clicking the ‘sign in’ button in the top right-hand side of the page, and entering their newly set sign-in details.

## Navigation

Below are details and recommendations for how users should navigate around the Tool. 

### User dashboard

A user dashboard is a landing page from sign in that shows a user all of the reporting package and/or projects their account is linked to as well as 

Once a user has logged in, they will land on their ‘user dashboard’ page. In the top table, they will be able to see a list of the projects and/or reporting packages they have been linked to. In the bottom table they can see a list of the company accounts they are a part of. 

Users will have the option to review their inclusion in projects/reporting packages and company accounts they are linked with. To join either, users will have to accept the related invitations.



To do this, they need to navigate to the row in the ‘Company / Project Invites’ table that says their Project’s name, click on the small cogs at the end of the rows, and then select ‘accept’ for each of their invitations. 

### Left hand menu

Reporting Users should use the left-hand bottom menu (below the title, ‘Business Units’) to access their dashboards and reporting packages.

Please Note: There are different icons used in this menu to show the structure of a Company Project. Not all users will be able to see each level, but for reference:

- The Stacked office icon = Business Unit Names
- The Crossed Tools = Project Package Names

The first step to reporting is to access your Project Package. This is done simply by clicking the Project Package name in the bottom-left-hand-menu.

After selecting a package, the bottom-left-hand menu title will change from ‘Business Units’ to ‘Reporting Packages’. You can then go into your required reporting package by clicking the package name in this same menu (remember, reporting packages have the crossed tools icons).

## Key features and functionality

Below is a list of key features and functionality that all users should familiarise themselves with when starting out using the Tool.

### Metrics

Metrics correspond to the fields reporters will input data against in a project e.g. tonnes of waste recycled.

These are a standard of measurement by which reporting organisations can input information about their performance in specific areas.

There are over 300 standardised metrics for a User to choose from, with then a further option to create non-standard metrics as required. Users can choose as many or as few as they require at the project set up stage.

It is recommended that users only create metrics at a 'Project level' and then add them to reporting packages using the template functionality. This process ensures data reported by users in their reporting packages correspond to metrics used to generate the indicators displayed in the project-level dashboards.

Users can create metrics at a 'reporting package' level but this approach is not recommended.

- Go to your project home

- In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'

- Once in the metrics page, click the ‘Set up Metrics’ drop down and select ‘Add Sustainability Issue'

- Select the relevant sustainability issue* for your metric and click 'Submit'

- Click the settings icon on the same row as the sustainability issue you selected in step 4. Click 'Add Metric'

- Enter the name and definition of the metric, and select the relevant unit*. Click 'Submit'

- To create another metric, under the same sustainability issue, repeat steps 5 and 6 contact charles.naud@actionsustainability.com for additional dropdown options for sustainability issues and units.

### Indicators

These are used to gauge performance that gives the user and understanding of how their project is performing in specific fields.

In the Tool, indicators are informed by the data reported through the performance data being collected via metrics set at a reporting package level.  

Gauges of performance that gives the user and understanding of how their project is performing in specific measures areas.

In the Tool, indicators are informed by the data reported through the selected metrics in a project’s work package(s). An example of this could be:

(Metric 1 / Metric 2) x 100 = Indicator 1

Metric 1 = Total number of staff who were previously unemployed before project on the project.
Metric 2 = Total number of staff on a project

Indicator 1 = % of staff who were unemployed before joining the project#


### Conversion factors

Conversion factors enable to calculate a metric from sub-metrics in a different unit e.g. 'scope 3 carbon emissions' in CO2e from the sub-metric 'non-hazardous waste' in tonnes.

Where required, the tool uses conversion factors to make sure that the metric figures are appropriate to the requirements of the indicator and reporting requirements of the project (i.e. Reporting users report total waste in KG, but the Client wants information in tonnes).

### Dashboards

Simply put, dashboards visualise performance data. Within the Tool, the following dashboards are available (with access rights set by the owner/admin account):

•	Reporting package Dashboard: Visualises all the performance data reported within an individual reporting package.

•	Project dashboard: Visualises a collated representation of all the reported performance data from the reporting packages that sit within a Project.

•	Business unit dashboard: Visualises a collated representation of all the reported performance data from the project packages that sit within a business unit.

The dashboards all conform to a standard template, making it easier for users to compare data across multiple levels and reports. Key features include:

Note: Currently, is a user makes a change that will impact their dashbaord, they need to refresh their browser to see said changes to their dashboard. Better functionality is being explored to automate this process moving forwards. For now then, if your dashboard doesnt appear to be working please try refreshing the page. If it continues to not work, please contact XXXX@actionsustainability.com

- Sustainability issue tiles (RAG rated)

These are - TBC

- Indicator tiles (RAG rated)

These are - TBC

- Performance graphs

As well as visualising data through the Issue and indicator tiles, users will be able to see graphs related to performance. These graphs are interactive, allowing user to see performance of all indicators within a singular issue, but also with an ability to filter in and out units on the x-axis as desired. In one click then, the user can flip between seeing full performance for a particular issue and then drill down into performance against a particular indicator.

The graphs show both target and threshold lines agains the bar chart to easily visualise performance against requirements.

Note: A key point is that the Y-axis of the peformance graph located on the dashboard automatically scales to the indicator values it is displaying. This is so that the user is able to see a meaningful differences / patterns and changes as they switch between indicators on the graph, rather than limiting its functionality to a fixed axis. 

Query: On occasions the graphs may show figures that appear incorrect or impossible (i.e. +100%). This will likely be down to reporting error in the data. Please see the FAQs for guidance on this or cotanct XXX@actionssutainability.com for assitance. 

- Performance tables

These are - TBC

### Targets

Targets and thresholds benchmark performance for your project against your reporting indicators. These inform the Red, Amber, Green ratings seen on a project’s sustainability and issue tiles. 

Targets can be set at business unit, project and reporting package levels, allowing Users to easily dig down into a project's performance and supply-chain to see where targets are and are not being met and who is responsible.

### Document upload

Allow reporters to upload documents to complement the data they input against a metric e.g. waste transfer notes

- Go to your project home
- In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'
- Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to enable the document upload for. Click 'Enable Document Upload'
- Enter the Title and a description of the document you expect reporters to upload. Click 'Submit'. An integer in a bracket will indicate the document upload functionality is enabled for that metric
