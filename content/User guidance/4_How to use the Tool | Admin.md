## Getting setup


## [#](#-business-units) Business units

Company admin users can create business units to manage sustainability performance for a subset of their organisation’s operations. A company account can have, directly below it, multiple business units and projects, which all contribute to the data in the company dashboard. In turn, business units can have other business units and projects within them. These will contribute to the data in the ‘parent’ business unit dashboard. Business unit dashboards only show data from other business units and projects that are below them. As such, users can use this functionality to manage performance for groups of projects at multiple levels within their organisation.

### [#](#-set-reporting-package-metrics) Set reporting package metrics

1. To create additional reporting packages within a project, repeat steps 1 to 4

## [#](#-metrics) Metrics

Metrics correspond to the fields reporters will input data against in a project e.g. tonnes of waste recycled.

### [#](#-create-metrics) Create Metrics     

It is recommended that users only create metrics at a 'Project level' and then add them to reporting packages using the template functionality. This process ensures data reported by users in their reporting packages correspond to metrics used to generate the indicators displayed in the project-level dashboards.

Users can create metrics at a 'reporting package' level but this approach is not recommended.

1. Go to your project home

2. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'

3. Once in the metrics page, click the ‘Set up Metrics’ drop down and select ‘Add Sustainability Issue’

4. Select the relevant sustainability issue* for your metric and click 'Submit'

5. Click the settings icon on the same row as the sustainability issue you selected in step 4. Click 'Add Metric'

6. Enter the name and definition of the metric, and select the relevant unit*. Click 'Submit'

7. To create another metric, under the same sustainability issue, repeat steps 5 and 6

* contact charles.naud@actionsustainability.com for additional dropdown options for sustainability issues and units.

### [#](#-create-sub-metrics) Create sub-metrics
     

Sub-metrics are fields reporters will input data against that will aggregate into metrics. These are often used alongside conversion factors e.g. 'mains energy consumption' and 'mains gas consumption' may be sub-metrics of 'carbon scope 2 emissions' (with the relevant conversion factors applied).

Note 1: metrics are automatically calculated using by aggregating the data reported against their sub-metrics (using relevant conversion factors if applicable). Reporters can over-ride the automatic calculation.

Note 2: there may be several levels of sub-metrics e.g. 'domestic rail travel passenger miles' may be a sub-metric of 'total rail travel emissions' (with the relevant conversion factors applied), which is in turn a sub-metric of 'scope 3 carbon emissions'

1. Go to your project home

2. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'

3. Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to create a sub-metric for. Click 'Add Sub-Metric'

4. Enter the name and definition of the metric, and select the relevant unit*. Click 'Submit'

5. To create another metric, repeat steps 3 to 5

* if the unit of a sub-metric is different to that of its parent metric, a warning icon will appear to indicate that a conversion factor is required.

### [#](#-editing-metrics) Editing Metrics


#### [#](#-required-metrics) Required metrics   

1. Set metrics to 'required' to prevent reporters from submitting their data without inputting data against these fields.

2. Go to your project home

3. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'

4. Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to make compulsory. Click 'Toggle Required'

5. A red asterisk will indicate that the metric is 'required'

##### [#](#-setedit-frequency) Set/edit frequency

By default, reporters will be able to input data against for each metric for every reporting period. You can modify the frequency of a metric to a lesser frequency than the reporting period defined in the project settings e.g. reports are due monthly (this is the reporting period) but the metric 'floor area of project' is only due once.
##### [#](#-add-conversion-factors) Add conversion factors

1. Go to your project home

2. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'

3. Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to modify/edit the reporting frequency. Click 'Set Frequency'

4. Complete the fields: - due every: enter an integer - period: select the relevant - from date: select the second day in the reporting period you wish this metric to be first reported

5. Click 'Submit'. The frequency of the metric will now display in the metric row

6. To edit the metric frequency, repeat steps 1 to 5

Note: the frequency a metric should be reported cannot be lesser than the reporting period, which is set in the project settings.


### [#](#-delete-metrics) Delete Metrics  

There are two options for deleting metrics within reporting packages. Option 2 is a faster method for if you have a lot of metrics and a lot of reporting packages.

#####     Option 1 
The first option requires you to delete the metrics that you do not want, leaving those that you do want to keep remaining.
An important point to note is that if you do not want the metric or any of the sub metrics, you can delete the metric. This will remove all sub metrics. However if you want to keep only one sub metric and delete all of the other sub metrics, you must individually delete all sub metrics you do not want, leaving the sub metric that you do want.

1. Go to your reporting package

2. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'

3. Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to delete. Click 'Delete'

#####      Option 2
The second option is to save the metrics that you want to keep, and delete those you do not want, as a template. This template can then be applied to the reporting packages that you want to change the metrics for.

1. Go to your project home

2. Delete the metrics that you no longer require, using the steps in Option 1. 

3. In the Admin menu, select 'Settings'

4. In the 'Project details' section, give your template a name

5. In the 'Template settings' section, tick the box to confirm that you want to set it as a template

6. Now go to the reporting package that you want to apply this template to

7. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'

8. Delete all metrics, using the metric to delete multiple sub-metrics in one go

9. In the 'Set up metrics' in the right hand corner, select 'Add from template'

10. Select the name of the template that you have created from the template dropdown list

11. To transfer all of the metrics from your template over to 'Current metrics, you need to select 'Add' for each metric.

12. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics', you will see that all of your metrics have been updated. 

##### [#](#-enable-document-upload) Enable document upload

Allow reporters to upload documents to complement the data they input against a metric e.g. waste transfer notes
##### [#](#-edit-conversion-factors) Edit conversion factors
     

1. Go to your project home

2. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'

3. Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to enable the document upload for. Click 'Enable Document Upload'

4. Enter the Title and a description of the document you expect reporters to upload. Click 'Submit'. An integer in a bracket will indicate the document upload functionality is enabled for that metric

## [#](#-indicators) Indicators

Gauges of performance that gives the user and understanding of how their project is performing in specific measures areas.

### [#](#-create-indicators) Create Indicators

TBC

### [#](#-editing-indicators) Editing Indicators

TBC

### [#](#-setting-targets) Setting Targets

1. As a Client User, you can set targets and performance thresholds for your Project indicators. These inform the Red, Amber, Green rating you see on your Project’s Sustainability Issues and indicator panels. 

2. Targets can be set at a Corporate (Business Unit), Project and Reporting Package level, allowing you to easily dig down into your project supply-chain to see where targets are and are not being met and who is responsible.

3. To set your targets/thresholds, you will firstly need to decide if you want these to be set at a Business unit, Project or Reporting package level. Once you have decided, navigate to the dashboard at that level.

4. On the dashboard, you should firstly click on the Sustainability issue panel your indicator is within. Clicking the issues panel will show all the indicators that are set up in that field.

5. You then need to click on the indicator you wish to set a target for, to make sure it is only showing the performance data for that indicator in the graph below.

6. At this stage, two boxes should appear below the table beneath the heading, “Set Target and Thresholds”

7. You can then use the two boxes to input your indicator target and/or threshold

Note: The tool will automatically pick up whether ‘good’ performance is being above or below the target value (i.e. do you want to be above a certain limit or stay below it). If the Red/Amber Threshold value is set higher than the Target value, then the Tool will automatically know that you want your project to have metric scores below the target vale. 

## [#](#-conversion-factors) Conversion Factors

Conversion factors enable to calculate a metric from sub-metrics in a different unit e.g. 'scope 3 carbon emissions' in CO2e from the sub-metric 'non-hazardous waste' in tonnes.

To add or edit multiple conversion factors, please contact charles.naud@actionsustainability.com

### [#](#-adding-conversion-factors) Adding conversion factors
