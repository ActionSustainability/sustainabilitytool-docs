## Viewing performance

Depending on your access rights, as set by the Owner/Admin account, Reporting Users will be able to see varying granularity of both their own and project data through their User Dashboard. 

### Dashboards

Simply put, dashboards visualise performance data. Within the tool, the following dashboards are available (with access rights set by the Owner/Admin account):

•	Reporting Package Dashboard: Visualises all the performance data reported within an individual Reporting Package.

•	Project Dashboard: Visualises a collated representation of all the reported performance data from the Reporting Packages that sit within a Project.

•	Corporate Dashboard: Visualises a collated representation of all the reported performance data from the Project Packages that sit within a Business Unit.

The dashboards all conform to a standard template, making it easier for users to compare data across multiple levels and reports. Key features include:

•	Indicator Panels: Users will be able to see all the Sustainability Issues that the project they are involved with is collecting data against. These Issues act as ‘libraries’ for indicators and metrics, with a single issue often having multiple different performance variables inputting to it. Performance against thresholds/targets for each issue are shown by the colour of the panel:

o	Red = Performance Target was not met in the latest reporting period.

o	Amber = Performance was within target threshold in the latest reporting period.

o	Green = Performance target was exceeded for the latest reporting period.

By clicking on an issue panel, the user is then given a sub-set of indicator panels that sit within that issue. These again are formatted to show performance as per the above, giving the user a detailed breakdown as to how they are performing in specific performance areas. 

### Data

To be written

Graphs: Once a User has clicked into a panel, they will also be shown a performance graph. This shows the performance metric against time, giving the user a greater understanding of whether the project is improving or worsening against key performance indicators. 

Users can click on the legend on these graphs to add and remove indicators from that graph that sit within the selected sustainability issue.
