## Getting setup

##### [#](#-tool-registration-and-log-in) Tool Registration and log in

Reporting Users will receive an email inviting them to join a Company account on the Sustainability Tool. They should follow the simple steps outlined in the email, which includes opening a web link (https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/accounts/register/), entering their contact details and then creating a password.

Once registered, Reporting Users are able to access their account by going to https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/, clicking the ‘sign in’ button in the top right-hand side of the page, and entering their newly set sign-in details.

##### [#](#-project-registration) Project Registration

Once the Reporting User has logged in, they will land on their ‘User Dashboard’ page. They should then be able to see a list of their Company Memberships as well as the Project Reports that they have been assigned responsibility for completing. 

At this stage, the Reporting User will need to accept their invitations to report on their project work packages. 

To do this, they need to navigate to the row in the ‘Company / Project Invites’ table that says their Project’s name, click on the small cogs at the end of the rows, and then select ‘accept’ for each of their invitations. 

The work package/s name/s should then appear in the ‘My Projects and Reports’ table on their dashboard.

To go into a work package, the Reporting User can then simply click on the project title.

##### [#](#-navigation) Navigation

Reporting Users should use the left-hand bottom menu (below the title, ‘Business Units’) to access their dashboards and reporting packages.

Please Note: There are different icons used in this menu to show the structure of a Company Project. Not all users will be able to see each level, but for reference:

•	The Stacked office icon = Business Unit Names
•	The Crossed Tools = Project Package Names

The first step to reporting is to access your Project Package. This is done simply by clicking the Project Package name in the bottom-left-hand-menu.

After selecting a package, the bottom-left-hand menu title will change from ‘Business Units’ to ‘Reporting Packages’. You can then go into your required reporting package by clicking the package name in this same menu (remember, reporting packages have the crossed tools icons

## [#](#-inputting-your-performance-data) Inputting your performance data

To report your data, click the ‘Reports Due’ menu option in the top-left-hand menu once you are inside the correct Reporting Package as explained above.

As a Reporting User, you will then be shown a screen of all of the performance metrics that you have been assigned responsibility for assessing. 

Once you have entered all the data asked for in each metric and left your comments where possible, Reporting Users can simply click the ‘Submit for Approval’ button in the bottom right of the page.

Clicking this will open up a drop down option below for the Reporting User, whereby they can leave an overarching comment for the data reviewer about the information they have provided, and a drop-down menu option for the Reporting User to select the time period they are providing data for.

By clicking submit, the Reporting User will then be presented with a pop-up to confirm they are ready to submit their data which they then simply need to approve.
