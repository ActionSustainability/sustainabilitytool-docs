###TEST

The Sustainability Tool is a cloud-based sustainability performance reporting system, which has been specifically designed to be used for supply chain management. It enables you to collect, report & analyse social & environmental sustainability performance using smart dashboards at project, business unit and corporate levels.


## [#](#-how-does-it-work) How does it work?

The Tool is designed to mimic your supply chain and project management. 

At project level, the Tool is designed to be used post-award of a contract. You choose what to measure, and delegate to your supply chain to report. You then view their performance in real time, allowing you to act quickly on any issues that arise.

At business unit and corporate level, you can see the issues that your business is not performing well on, but also see the areas you are excelling on.

Data handling and reporting in the tool is structured as below:
