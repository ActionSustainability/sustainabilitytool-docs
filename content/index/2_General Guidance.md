### Metrics

These are a standard of measurement by which reporting organisations can input information about their performance in specific areas.

There are over 300 standardised metrics for a User to choose from, with then a further option to create non-standard metrics as required. Users can choose as many or as few as they require at the project set up stage.

### Indicators

These are used to gauge performance that gives the user and understanding of how their project is performing in specific fields.

In the Tool, indicators are informed by the data reported through the performance data being collected via metrics set at a reporting package level.  

### Conversion factors

Conversion factors enable to calculate a metric from sub-metrics in a different unit e.g. 'scope 3 carbon emissions' in CO2e from the sub-metric 'non-hazardous waste' in tonnes.

To add or edit multiple conversion factors, please contact charles.naud@actionsustainability.com

### Dashboards

Simply put, dashboards visualise performance data. Within the Tool, the following dashboards are available (with access rights set by the owner/admin account):

•	Reporting package Dashboard: Visualises all the performance data reported within an individual reporting package.

•	Project dashboard: Visualises a collated representation of all the reported performance data from the reporting packages that sit within a Project.

•	Business unit dashboard: Visualises a collated representation of all the reported performance data from the project packages that sit within a business unit.

The dashboards all conform to a standard template, making it easier for users to compare data across multiple levels and reports. Key features include:

- Sustainability tiles (RAG rated)
- Issue tiles (RAG rated)
- Performance graphs
- Performance tables

### Targets

Targets and thresholds benchmark performance for your project against your reporting indicators. These inform the Red, Amber, Green ratings seen on a project’s sustainability and issue tiles. 

Targets can be set at business unit, project and reporting package levels, allowing Users to easily dig down into a project's performance and supply-chain to see where targets are and are not being met and who is responsible.
