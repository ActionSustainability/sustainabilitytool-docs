## The role of a data approver

An approver is responsible for checking that the data submitted by the reporter is correct (sense-checking) and either approving or rejecting the report submitted. An approver will likely be responsible for approving multiple reporting packages and will have an understanding of sustainability data; therefore, they should be a sustainability professional within the project or working for the client company.

If an approver approves a report, the data then feeds into the main companyâ€™s sustainability performance. If they reject the report, the reporter must then make the required changes, before the approver can then accept the report.

Note: admin users are often also designated as approvers.
