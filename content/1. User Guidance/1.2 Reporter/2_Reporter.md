# Reporter

## The role of a reporter

The main role of a reporter is to enter their company’s sustainability performance data into the tool.

The reporter will likely be an individual within a Tier 1/2/3 supplier and will report their data via reporting packages set at pre-arranged intervals, often monthly.

The reporter will be required to input quantitative data, against specified metrics. The reporter may also add comments and/or upload evidence documents. A reporter can only ever report data for their specified reporting package(s); they can see dashboards for their reporting package and, subject to permission, may have access to the project, supplier or client dashboards above.

Within a project or supplier, several reporters can be assigned to multiple reporting packages. This can help to spread the reporting load across individuals within an organisation or project. Alternatively, reporting can also be automatically carried out by data collection software applications via the Sustainability Tool API.

Once reported, the data will be approved or rejected by the Approver user and, once it is approved, will feed into the sustainability performance dashboards.

## Getting setup

### Tool Registration and log in

Reporters will receive an email inviting them to join a Company account on the Sustainability Tool. They should follow the simple steps outlined in the email, which includes opening a web link (https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/accounts/register/), entering their contact details and then creating a password.

Once registered, Reporters are able to access their account by going to https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/, clicking the ‘sign in’ button in the top right-hand side of the page, and entering their newly set sign-in details.

### Project Registration

Once the Reporter has logged in, they will land on their ‘User Dashboard’ page. They should then be able to see a list of their Company Memberships as well as the Project Reports that they have been assigned responsibility for completing.

At this stage, the Reporter will need to accept their invitations to report on their project work packages.

To do this, they need to navigate to the row in the ‘Company / Project Invites’ table that says their Project’s name, click on the small cogs at the end of the rows, and then select ‘accept’ for each of their invitations.

The work package/s name/s should then appear in the ‘My Projects and Reports’ table on their dashboard.

To go into a work package, the Reporter can then simply click on the project title.

### Navigation

Reporters should use the left-hand bottom menu (below the title, ‘Business Units’) to access their dashboards and reporting packages.

Please Note: There are different icons used in this menu to show the structure of a Company Project. Not all users will be able to see each level, but for reference:

•	The Stacked office icon = Business Unit Names
•	The Crossed Tools = Project Package Names

The first step to reporting is to access your Project Package. This is done simply by clicking the Project Package name in the bottom-left-hand-menu.

After selecting a package, the bottom-left-hand menu title will change from ‘Business Units’ to ‘Reporting Packages’. You can then go into your required reporting package by clicking the package name in this same menu (remember, reporting packages have the crossed tools icons

## Inputting your performance data

To report your data, click the ‘Reports Due’ menu option in the top-left-hand menu once you are inside the correct Reporting Package as explained above.

As a Reporter, you will then be shown a screen of all of the performance metrics that you have been assigned responsibility for assessing.

Once you have entered all the data asked for in each metric and left your comments where possible, Reporters can simply click the ‘Submit for Approval’ button in the bottom right of the page.

Clicking this will open up a drop down option below for the Reporter, whereby they can leave an overarching comment for the data reviewer about the information they have provided, and a drop-down menu option for the Reporter to select the time period they are providing data for.

By clicking submit, the Reporter will then be presented with a pop-up to confirm they are ready to submit their data which they then simply need to approve.

### Adding documents

Reporters may be required to upload documentation to support the performance figures entered for specific metrics.

On the reports due page, Reporters will be able to see a full list of the metrics they are required to report against. If document upload functionality has been requested for a metric, Reporters will be able to see this at the end of the row for the required metric. There will be a grey button with 'select file' on it as well as a bracketed number which references the number of documents required.

To upload a document:

1. Click the 'select file' button at the end of the metric row on the 'Reports due' page. This will bring up a window to your files.

2. Select the file you want to use and click 'upload'. You will then be able to see the file on the 'Reports due' page at the end of the related metric's row. There will be two new buttons, one blue with the word 'upload' and one grey with the word 'clear'.

3. If you are happy with the selected file, click upload. If you have selected the wrong file, click clear and start again from point 1.
