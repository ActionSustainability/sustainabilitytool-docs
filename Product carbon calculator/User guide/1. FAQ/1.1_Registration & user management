## Registration & user management

### Q: How do I register for the PCC?
A: Visit https://product.sustainabilitytool.com/ and follow the registration process. It's free for organisations to start measuring and reporting the embodied carbon of their products and assets.

### Q: Can I use the same login details for the PCC as I do for other solutions on the Sustainability Tool, like the Carbon Calculator or Diversity Survey?
A: Yes, you can. Your existing login details for any tool within the Sustainability Tool suite, such as the Carbon Calculator or Diversity Survey or any other solution found at www.sustainabilitytool.com, will grant you access to the PCC, allowing you to manage all your sustainability reporting in one place.

### Q: Can I add multiple users from my organisation to the PCC?
A: Yes, each individual within your organisation can have their own login, allowing for a personalised experience. Users can manage multiple company accounts if needed.
