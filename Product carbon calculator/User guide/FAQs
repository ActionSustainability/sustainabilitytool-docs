## Embodied carbon queries

### Q: What is embodied carbon?
A: Embodied carbon refers to the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with the lifecycle of an asset, product or project. The Product Carbon Calculator currently enables to measure embodied emissions for assets and products across the Production Phase (A1-A4) and the Use Phase (B8) for assets.
For more information on embodied emissions and whole life costs, please refer to the user guide.

### Q: Can the PCC track emissions from the operation of my assets?
A: Yes, the PCC tracks operational emissions for other processes (B8) that may release emissions during the asset's life. It does not currently cover energy use (B6) and water use (B7).

### Q: How do I add data for different lifecycle stages in the PCC?
A: To add data, navigate to the appropriate section (A1-A4 and B8) and fill in the details for each stage, such as materials used and transport methods. Use the '+' button to add entries for additional materials or transport legs.

## Reporting

### Q: What should I do if I make an error in data entry?
A: If you need to correct an error, you can delete entries using the bin icon next to the line item. If you need to edit submitted data, copy the asset back to drafts, make your changes, and then resubmit.

## Q: Is it mandatory to complete all fields in the PCC?
A: Yes, any field marked with an asterisk (*) is mandatory for accurate emissions calculation and must be completed.

## Q: How does the PCC ensure data accuracy?
A: The PCC uses a Data Accuracy Rating system, which categorises data based on the source of the emission factor. It ranges from 'Green' for high accuracy using EPDs or custom factors, to 'Red' for lower accuracy with default emission factors. See the user guidance for more specific instructions on how to complete this field.

## Q: Can I include custom emission factors in the PCC?
A: Yes, you can enter custom emission factors if you have more precise manufacturing data, transport or energy data, which allows for a more accurate carbon footprint calculation.
