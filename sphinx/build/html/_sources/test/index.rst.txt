An Introduction to the Sustainability Tool
==========================================

What is the Tool?
-----------------

The Sustainability Tool is a cloud-based sustainability performance reporting system, which has been specifically designed to be used for supply chain management. It enables you to collect, report & analyse social & environmental sustainability performance using smart dashboards at project, business unit and corporate levels.

Who uses it?
------------

The Tool is built for those who are interested in better understanding how they are performing against key sustainability targets, with a strength in mapping this for supply-chains. Users of the tool will include:


* 
  Clients

* 
  Tier 1 contractors

* 
  Sub-contractors

* 
  Specialist designers

* 
  Suppliers and more


General guidance
================

Getting Started
---------------

Users will receive an email inviting them to join a company account on the Sustainability Tool. They should follow the simple steps outlined in the email, which includes opening a web link (https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/accounts/register/), entering their contact details and then creating a password for their account.

Once registered, users are able to access their account by going to https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/, clicking the ‘sign in’ button in the top right-hand side of the page, and entering their newly set sign-in details.

Navigation
----------

The Sustainability Tool has two navigational menus:


* 
  **Left Hand Menu:** Used for navigating the structure of a company project (i.e between reporting package, project, business and corporate levels)

* 
  **Top Menu:** Used for moving between different actions/activities available within the Tool, including management of a user's account.

Key features
------------

Some of the key features that all users should familiarise themselves with when starting out using the Tool are listed below. These have been grouped by type:

**\ *Measuring Performance*\ **


* 
  **Metrics:** Quantifiable measures that are used to track and assess performance against sustainability issues.

* 
  **Indicators:** Guages used to assess performance against measured sustainability issues.

* 
  **Targets & Thresholds:** Targets and thresholds benchmark performance for your project against your reporting indicators. These inform the Red, Amber, Green ratings seen on a project’s sustainability and issue tiles. 

* 
  **Conversion Factors:** Used within the Tool to enable the calculation of a metric from sub-metrics in a different unit e.g. 'scope 3 carbon emissions' in CO2e from the sub-metric 'non-hazardous waste' in tonnes.

**\ *Viewing Performance*\ **


* 
  **Dashboards:** Dashboards visualise performance data inputted into the Sustainability Tool. Dashboards are available at each structural level within a company project, allowing Users to see different aggregations of performance. 

* 
  **Sustainability Tiles:** Each tile relates to a specific sustainability issue being tracked within a company project. Each is RAG rated in line with the peformance against indicators feeding into each issue (e.g. air quality, community, employees)

* 
  **Indicator Tiles:** Indicator tiles visualise your performance against a particular indicator. Each is RAG rated to denote performance against defined targets and thresholds within the company project (e.g. % of total plant on site that is ‘clean’, Number of access and engagement initiatives)

* 
  **Performance Graphs:** Graphically visualises the cumulative performance of a company project a spcefic indicator they are measuring / being measured against over a 6-month period. 

* 
  **Performance Tables:** Show the reported numerical data being used to measure performance against targeted indicators within the Sustainability Tool for a company project. 

* 
  **Reports Submitted:** A landing page showing a comprehensive list of all the reports submitted within a reporting package. Users can view individual reports to see the specific data entered. 

Key functionality
-----------------

Some of the key functions/acttions that all users should familiarise themselves with when starting out using the Tool are listed below. These have been grouped by type:

**\ *Reporting Performance*\ **


* 
  **Reports Due:** A landing page that shows Users a complete list of the metrics that they are required to report for that reporting period (inc. units and frequency of reporting)

* 
  **Document Upload:** Allows Users to upload documents to complement the data they input against a metric (e.g. waste transfer notes)

* 
  **API:** A software intermediary system that allows Users to pull data for reporting into the Sustainability Tool from existing external systems (e.g. Environmental Management Systems).


FAQs
====

Reporting Data
--------------

**How do I report data?**  

There are three way of reporting data:


* 
  Reports Due: Use the top menu in the Sustainability Tool to navigate to the 'Reports Due' page. From here, you will be sent to a landing page listing all of the metrics you need to report against for the reporting period.

* 
  API: Functionality within the Tool allows for an API to automatically pull data through from existing external systems. Please contact charles.naud@actionsustainability.com to discuss set up.

* 
  Document Upload: Certain documentation can be asked for to be submitted alongside metrics. Document upload functionality (where setup) is seen at the end of metric rows on the 'Reports Due' page.

**What happens to my reported data?**  

Once you have submitted your performance data for a reporting period, a notification will be automatically sent to User(s) responsible for reviewing your data. They will then evaluate the information for errors, before either accepting or rejecting the submitted report. The following is true for each:


* 
  Accepted: Your data will be collected and aggregated into the existing data within a company project. This information will visible on dashboards, project graphs and project tables.

* 
  Rejected: As the reporter, you will recieve and email notification that your submitted data has rejected. To amend your data, you will need to login to the Tool, access your reports submitted through the top menu, select 'view' on the rejected reporting package and then resubmit your data once you have made the amendments. To note, reviewers have the option to leave comments next to each metric so it should be easy to identify issues. 

**Why can't I report against some metrics?**  

During the project setup, your account will have been designed so that you are only able to access certain areas within the Tool and are responsible for only reporting against relevant metrics.

It may also be the case that the reason you cant report against is that no data is requested for that period. Metrics have different frequencies meaning some may be needed monthly, with others only every 6 months. You can see the reporting frequency for a metric, and when it next needs to be reported, on the right of each row in your 'reports due' page.

If you are not able to report against a metric but believe you should be, please email charles.naud@actionsustainability.com

**What do I do if I have submitted the wrong information?**  

If you have entered incorrect data incorrectly, please email your data approver. They will be able to reject the reporting package that needs to be edited which will then allow you to go back and alter the information.

For any altered data, please leave a comment next to the changed metrics to note what has changed and why.

**Why can't i see my reported data on the dashboard and graphs?**  

Your reported data will only be seen within the Tool once it has been accepted in the following areas:


* 
  Issue and Indicator Tiles

* 
  Performance Graphs

Data that has been submitted but not accepted is shown in the performance table at the bottom of a dashboard. This data is still visible once accepted, but it is the only place on the dashboard where non-accepted data is visible and accounted for. 

Reviewing Performance
---------------------

**Why are some of my issue and indicator tiles grey?**  

The Sustainability Tool uses RAG rating to denote performance against targets and thresholds (red: below target+threshold, amber: between target and threshold, green: above target).

A grey tile is shown for two reasons:


#. 
   That issue or indicator has no target set against it and therefore no descernible performance.

#. 
   The metric data required to calculate the indicator has not been reported and therefore no performance can be measured.

If you believe an indicator has complete data and targets set for it, but it is still showing as grey, please contact charles.naud@actionsustainability.com

**What is the difference between a sustainability issue and a sustainability indicator?**  

Put simply, indicators feed into issues, with the sustainability issues acting as categories within which indicators sit.

Performance against an indicator is calculated by reported metrics, whereas the performance (and RAG colouring) for the sustainability issues comes from the indicators within said issue. Therefore:

Metrics --> Indicator --> Sustainability Issues

**Why can i see data in my performance table but not on the performance graph?**  

The performance tables collect and visualise all data that has been entered into the Tool (for that particular level and indicator) whereas graphs only display data that has been accepted by an approver.

Therefore if a table is showing three months of data but said data is not on the performance graph, it will likely mean that your data hasnt been accepted and/or data may have been reviewed and rejected. You can check the status of your submitted reports on the 'reports submitted' page, accessible through the top navigation menu.
