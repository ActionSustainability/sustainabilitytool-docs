<h2>The role of a data viewer<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-a-data-viewer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A data viewer is a user within the main company who wishes to see the dashboard and performance against targets. This will likely be an individual within the main company who is not involved with sustainability performance reporting, but who wants to see project performance, such as a director.</p>
<p>Data viewers will not have access to submitted reporting packages and will not be able to edit any business units, projects, reporting packages, metrics or indicators. They will only be able to view the submitted and approved data, in the form of project dashboards and performance data against targets.</p>

<p>Depending on your access rights, as set by the Owner/Admin account, Reporting Users will be able to see varying granularity of both their own and project data through their User Dashboard.</p>
<p>Simply put, dashboards visualise performance data. Within the tool, the following dashboards are available (with access rights set by the Owner/Admin account):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Reporting Package Dashboard: Visualises all the performance data reported within an individual Reporting Package.</p></li>
<li><p>Project Dashboard: Visualises a collated representation of all the reported performance data from the Reporting Packages that sit within a Project.</p></li>
<li><p>Corporate Dashboard: Visualises a collated representation of all the reported performance data from the Project Packages that sit within a Business Unit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dashboards all conform to a standard template, making it easier for users to compare data across multiple levels and reports. Key features include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Indicator Panels: Users will be able to see all the Sustainability Issues that the project they are involved with is collecting data against. These Issues act as ‘libraries’ for indicators and metrics, with a single issue often having multiple different performance variables inputting to it. Performance against thresholds/targets for each issue are shown by the colour of the panel:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>o   Red = Performance Target was not met in the latest reporting period.</p>
<p>o   Amber = Performance was within target threshold in the latest reporting period.</p>
<p>o   Green = Performance target was exceeded for the latest reporting period.</p>
<p>By clicking on an issue panel, the user is then given a sub-set of indicator panels that sit within that issue. These again are formatted to show performance as per the above, giving the user a detailed breakdown as to how they are performing in specific performance areas.</p>
<p>To be written</p>
<p>Graphs: Once a User has clicked into a panel, they will also be shown a performance graph. This shows the performance metric against time, giving the user a greater understanding of whether the project is improving or worsening against key performance indicators.</p>
<p>Users can click on the legend on these graphs to add and remove indicators from that graph that sit within the selected sustainability issue.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-role-of-an-admin">
<h2>The role of an admin<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-an-admin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There will be approximately four to five admins per client account. The admins will be individuals who are highly involved in the company’s sustainability performance and working with Action Sustainability during the configuration-phase of the Tool, for example: sustainability managers, procurement managers or environmental managers.</p>
<p>An admin has the highest level of authority within the Tool.</p>
<p>They have the highest level of editorial authority and are able to create, make changes to the settings of and delete the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>business units, projects and reporting packages;</p></li>
<li><p>other users;</p></li>
<li><p>metrics and indicators;</p></li>
<li><p>targets and thresholds.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Admins also have the highest level of viewing authority. They view all business units, projects and reporting packages they are set up in. They see all reports submitted and have the ability to approve or reject reports. As they can see all project dashboards, they see all sustainability measurement data, progress against targets and the RAG (Red, Amber, Green) status of all indicators. They also see the status of reporting packages (Approved, Pending Approval, Requires Revision or Nothing Received). Admins can see the names of all individuals involved, what level of authority they have and what project or reporting package they are associated with.</p>

<p>Company admin users can create business units to manage sustainability performance for a subset of their organisation’s operations. A company account can have, directly below it, multiple business units and projects, which all contribute to the data in the company dashboard. In turn, business units can have other business units and projects within them. These will contribute to the data in the ‘parent’ business unit dashboard. Business unit dashboards only show data from other business units and projects that are below them. As such, users can use this functionality to manage performance for groups of projects at multiple levels within their organisation.</p>

<p>Metrics correspond to the fields reporters will input data against in a project e.g. tonnes of waste recycled.</p>
<p>It is recommended that users only create metrics at a ‘Project level’ and then add them to reporting packages using the template functionality. This process ensures data reported by users in their reporting packages correspond to metrics used to generate the indicators displayed in the project-level dashboards.</p>
<p>Users can create metrics at a ‘reporting package’ level but this approach is not recommended.</p>

<p>Sub-metrics are fields reporters will input data against that will aggregate into metrics. These are often used alongside conversion factors e.g. ‘mains energy consumption’ and ‘mains gas consumption’ may be sub-metrics of ‘carbon scope 2 emissions’ (with the relevant conversion factors applied).</p>
<p>Note 1: metrics are automatically calculated using by aggregating the data reported against their sub-metrics (using relevant conversion factors if applicable). Reporters can over-ride the automatic calculation.</p>
<p>Note 2: there may be several levels of sub-metrics e.g. ‘domestic rail travel passenger miles’ may be a sub-metric of ‘total rail travel emissions’ (with the relevant conversion factors applied), which is in turn a sub-metric of ‘scope 3 carbon emissions’</p>

<p>A data approver is responsible for checking that the data submitted by the reporter is correct (sense-checking) and either approving or rejecting the report submitted. An approver will likely be responsible for approving multiple reporting packages and will have an understanding of sustainability data; therefore, they should be a sustainability professional within the project or working for the client company.</p>
<p>If an approver approves a report, the data then feeds into the main company’s sustainability performance. If they reject the report, the reporter must then make the required changes, before the approver can then accept the report.</p>

<h2>The role of a reporter<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-a-reporter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main role of a reporter is to enter their company’s sustainability performance data into the tool.</p>
<p>The reporter will likely be an individual within a Tier 1/2/3 supplier and will report their data via reporting packages set at pre-arranged intervals, often monthly.</p>
<p>The reporter will be required to input quantitative data, against specified metrics. The reporter may also add comments and/or upload evidence documents. A reporter can only ever report data for their specified reporting package(s); they can see dashboards for their reporting package and, subject to permission, may have access to the project, supplier or client dashboards above.</p>
<p>Within a project or supplier, several reporters can be assigned to multiple reporting packages. This can help to spread the reporting load across individuals within an organisation or project. Alternatively, reporting can also be automatically carried out by data collection software applications via the Sustainability Tool API.</p>
<p>Once reported, the data will be approved or rejected by the Approver user and, once it is approved, will feed into the sustainability performance dashboards.</p>

<p>Reporters will receive an email inviting them to join a Company account on the Sustainability Tool. They should follow the simple steps outlined in the email, which includes opening a web link (<a class="reference external" href="https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/accounts/register/">https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/accounts/register/</a>), entering their contact details and then creating a password.</p>
<p>Once registered, Reporters are able to access their account by going to <a class="reference external" href="https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/">https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/</a>, clicking the ‘sign in’ button in the top right-hand side of the page, and entering their newly set sign-in details.</p>
<p>Once the Reporter has logged in, they will land on their ‘User Dashboard’ page. They should then be able to see a list of their Company Memberships as well as the Project Reports that they have been assigned responsibility for completing.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Reporter will need to accept their invitations to report on their project work packages.</p>
<p>To do this, they need to navigate to the row in the ‘Company / Project Invites’ table that says their Project’s name, click on the small cogs at the end of the rows, and then select ‘accept’ for each of their invitations.</p>
<p>The work package/s name/s should then appear in the ‘My Projects and Reports’ table on their dashboard.</p>
<p>To go into a work package, the Reporter can then simply click on the project title.</p>
<p>Reporters should use the left-hand bottom menu (below the title, ‘Business Units’) to access their dashboards and reporting packages.</p>
<p>Please Note: There are different icons used in this menu to show the structure of a Company Project. Not all users will be able to see each level, but for reference:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Stacked office icon = Business Unit Names</p></li>
<li><p>The Crossed Tools = Project Package Names</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first step to reporting is to access your Project Package. This is done simply by clicking the Project Package name in the bottom-left-hand-menu.</p>
<p>After selecting a package, the bottom-left-hand menu title will change from ‘Business Units’ to ‘Reporting Packages’. You can then go into your required reporting package by clicking the package name in this same menu (remember, reporting packages have the crossed tools icons</p>

<p>As a Reporter, you will then be shown a screen of all of the performance metrics that you have been assigned responsibility for assessing.</p>
<p>Once you have entered all the data asked for in each metric and left your comments where possible, Reporters can simply click the ‘Submit for Approval’ button in the bottom right of the page.</p>
<p>Clicking this will open up a drop down option below for the Reporter, whereby they can leave an overarching comment for the data reviewer about the information they have provided, and a drop-down menu option for the Reporter to select the time period they are providing data for.</p>
<p>By clicking submit, the Reporter will then be presented with a pop-up to confirm they are ready to submit their data which they then simply need to approve.</p>
