`# <#-how-to-use-the-tool-\-viewer>`_ How to use the Tool | Viewer
======================================================================

The role of a data viewer
-------------------------

A data viewer is a user within the main company who wishes to see the dashboard and performance against targets. This will likely be an individual within the main company who is not involved with sustainability performance reporting, but who wants to see project performance, such as a director. 

Data viewers will not have access to submitted reporting packages and will not be able to edit any business units, projects, reporting packages, metrics or indicators. They will only be able to view the submitted and approved data, in the form of project dashboards and performance data against targets. 

Getting setup
-------------

See reporting user section for guidance

`# <#-viewing-project-members>`_ Viewing project members
------------------------------------------------------------

To be completed

This lets the Client User see all the member accounts linked to the specific business unit, project or work package they are reviewing, as well as their authority (i.e. their responsibilities).

`# <#-add-reporter>`_ Add reporter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to your project dashboard by clicking on the relevant project in the left-hand menu.

In the Project menu, select ‘Members’

In the members section, click ‘Send Invite’

Enter the user’s email address and select the relevant reporting package. Click ‘Submit’

Repeat steps 3 and 4 to submit new invitations

`# <#-viewing-performance>`_ Viewing performance
----------------------------------------------------

Depending on your access rights, as set by the Owner/Admin account, Reporting Users will be able to see varying granularity of both their own and project data through their User Dashboard. 

`# <#-dashboards>`_ Dashboards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simply put, dashboards visualise performance data. Within the tool, the following dashboards are available (with access rights set by the Owner/Admin account):

•   Reporting Package Dashboard: Visualises all the performance data reported within an individual Reporting Package.

•   Project Dashboard: Visualises a collated representation of all the reported performance data from the Reporting Packages that sit within a Project.

•   Corporate Dashboard: Visualises a collated representation of all the reported performance data from the Project Packages that sit within a Business Unit.

The dashboards all conform to a standard template, making it easier for users to compare data across multiple levels and reports. Key features include:

•   Indicator Panels: Users will be able to see all the Sustainability Issues that the project they are involved with is collecting data against. These Issues act as ‘libraries’ for indicators and metrics, with a single issue often having multiple different performance variables inputting to it. Performance against thresholds/targets for each issue are shown by the colour of the panel:

o   Red = Performance Target was not met in the latest reporting period.

o   Amber = Performance was within target threshold in the latest reporting period.

o   Green = Performance target was exceeded for the latest reporting period.

By clicking on an issue panel, the user is then given a sub-set of indicator panels that sit within that issue. These again are formatted to show performance as per the above, giving the user a detailed breakdown as to how they are performing in specific performance areas. 

`# <#-data>`_ Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To be written

Graphs: Once a User has clicked into a panel, they will also be shown a performance graph. This shows the performance metric against time, giving the user a greater understanding of whether the project is improving or worsening against key performance indicators. 

Users can click on the legend on these graphs to add and remove indicators from that graph that sit within the selected sustainability issue. 


`# <#-how-to-use-the-tool-\-admin>`_ How to use the Tool | Admin
====================================================================

The role of an admin
--------------------

There will be approximately four to five admins per client account. The admins will be individuals who are highly involved in the company’s sustainability performance and working with Action Sustainability during the configuration-phase of the Tool, for example: sustainability managers, procurement managers or environmental managers. 

An admin has the highest level of authority within the Tool. 

They have the highest level of editorial authority and are able to create, make changes to the settings of and delete the following: 


* 
  business units, projects and reporting packages;

* 
  other users;

* 
  metrics and indicators;

* 
  targets and thresholds.

Admins also have the highest level of viewing authority. They view all business units, projects and reporting packages they are set up in. They see all reports submitted and have the ability to approve or reject reports. As they can see all project dashboards, they see all sustainability measurement data, progress against targets and the RAG (Red, Amber, Green) status of all indicators. They also see the status of reporting packages (Approved, Pending Approval, Requires Revision or Nothing Received). Admins can see the names of all individuals involved, what level of authority they have and what project or reporting package they are associated with. 

Getting setup
-------------

`# <#-business-units>`_ Business units
------------------------------------------

Company admin users can create business units to manage sustainability performance for a subset of their organisation’s operations. A company account can have, directly below it, multiple business units and projects, which all contribute to the data in the company dashboard. In turn, business units can have other business units and projects within them. These will contribute to the data in the ‘parent’ business unit dashboard. Business unit dashboards only show data from other business units and projects that are below them. As such, users can use this functionality to manage performance for groups of projects at multiple levels within their organisation.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#. To create additional reporting packages within a project, repeat steps 1 to 4

`# <#-metrics>`_ Metrics
----------------------------

Metrics correspond to the fields reporters will input data against in a project e.g. tonnes of waste recycled.

`# <#-create-metrics>`_ Create Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommended that users only create metrics at a 'Project level' and then add them to reporting packages using the template functionality. This process ensures data reported by users in their reporting packages correspond to metrics used to generate the indicators displayed in the project-level dashboards.

Users can create metrics at a 'reporting package' level but this approach is not recommended.


#. Go to your project home


#. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'


#. Once in the metrics page, click the ‘Set up Metrics’ drop down and select ‘Add Sustainability Issue’


#. Select the relevant sustainability issue* for your metric and click 'Submit'


#. Click the settings icon on the same row as the sustainability issue you selected in step 4. Click 'Add Metric'


#. Enter the name and definition of the metric, and select the relevant unit*. Click 'Submit'


#. To create another metric, under the same sustainability issue, repeat steps 5 and 6


* contact charles.naud@actionsustainability.com for additional dropdown options for sustainability issues and units.

`# <#-create-sub-metrics>`_ Create sub-metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sub-metrics are fields reporters will input data against that will aggregate into metrics. These are often used alongside conversion factors e.g. 'mains energy consumption' and 'mains gas consumption' may be sub-metrics of 'carbon scope 2 emissions' (with the relevant conversion factors applied).

Note 1: metrics are automatically calculated using by aggregating the data reported against their sub-metrics (using relevant conversion factors if applicable). Reporters can over-ride the automatic calculation.

Note 2: there may be several levels of sub-metrics e.g. 'domestic rail travel passenger miles' may be a sub-metric of 'total rail travel emissions' (with the relevant conversion factors applied), which is in turn a sub-metric of 'scope 3 carbon emissions'


#. Go to your project home


#. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'


#. Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to create a sub-metric for. Click 'Add Sub-Metric'


#. Enter the name and definition of the metric, and select the relevant unit*. Click 'Submit'


#. To create another metric, repeat steps 3 to 5


* if the unit of a sub-metric is different to that of its parent metric, a warning icon will appear to indicate that a conversion factor is required.

`# <#-editing-metrics>`_ Editing Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`# <#-required-metrics>`_ Required metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#. Set metrics to 'required' to prevent reporters from submitting their data without inputting data against these fields.


#. Go to your project home


#. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'


#. Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to make compulsory. Click 'Toggle Required'


#. A red asterisk will indicate that the metric is 'required'

`# <#-setedit-frequency>`_ Set/edit frequency
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, reporters will be able to input data against for each metric for every reporting period. You can modify the frequency of a metric to a lesser frequency than the reporting period defined in the project settings e.g. reports are due monthly (this is the reporting period) but the metric 'floor area of project' is only due once.

`# <#-add-conversion-factors>`_ Add conversion factors
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


#. Go to your project home


#. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'


#. Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to modify/edit the reporting frequency. Click 'Set Frequency'


#. Complete the fields: - due every: enter an integer - period: select the relevant - from date: select the second day in the reporting period you wish this metric to be first reported


#. Click 'Submit'. The frequency of the metric will now display in the metric row


#. To edit the metric frequency, repeat steps 1 to 5

Note: the frequency a metric should be reported cannot be lesser than the reporting period, which is set in the project settings.

`# <#-delete-metrics>`_ Delete Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two options for deleting metrics within reporting packages. Option 2 is a faster method for if you have a lot of metrics and a lot of reporting packages.

Option 1
""""""""

The first option requires you to delete the metrics that you do not want, leaving those that you do want to keep remaining.

An important point to note is that if you do not want the metric or any of the sub metrics, you can delete the metric. This will remove all sub metrics. However if you want to keep only one sub metric and delete all of the other sub metrics, you must individually delete all sub metrics you do not want, leaving the sub metric that you do want.


#. Go to your reporting package


#. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'


#. Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to delete. Click 'Delete'

Option 2
""""""""

The second option is to save the metrics that you want to keep, and delete those you do not want, as a template. This template can then be applied to the reporting packages that you want to change the metrics for.


#. Go to your project home


#. Delete the metrics that you no longer require, using the steps in Option 1. 


#. In the Admin menu, select 'Settings'


#. In the 'Project details' section, give your template a name


#. In the 'Template settings' section, tick the box to confirm that you want to set it as a template


#. Now go to the reporting package that you want to apply this template to


#. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'


#. Delete all metrics, using the metric to delete multiple sub-metrics in one go


#. In the 'Set up metrics' in the right hand corner, select 'Add from template'


#. Select the name of the template that you have created from the template dropdown list


#. To transfer all of the metrics from your template over to 'Current metrics, you need to select 'Add' for each metric.


#. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics', you will see that all of your metrics have been updated. 

`# <#-enable-document-upload>`_ Enable document upload
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Allow reporters to upload documents to complement the data they input against a metric e.g. waste transfer notes

`# <#-edit-conversion-factors>`_ Edit conversion factors
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


#. Go to your project home


#. In the Admin menu, select 'Metrics'


#. Click the settings icon on the same row as the metric you wish to enable the document upload for. Click 'Enable Document Upload'


#. Enter the Title and a description of the document you expect reporters to upload. Click 'Submit'. An integer in a bracket will indicate the document upload functionality is enabled for that metric

`# <#-setting-targets>`_ Setting Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#. As a Client User, you can set targets and performance thresholds for your Project indicators. These inform the Red, Amber, Green rating you see on your Project’s Sustainability Issues and indicator panels. 


#. Targets can be set at a Corporate (Business Unit), Project and Reporting Package level, allowing you to easily dig down into your project supply-chain to see where targets are and are not being met and who is responsible.


#. To set your targets/thresholds, you will firstly need to decide if you want these to be set at a Business unit, Project or Reporting package level. Once you have decided, navigate to the dashboard at that level.


#. On the dashboard, you should firstly click on the Sustainability issue panel your indicator is within. Clicking the issues panel will show all the indicators that are set up in that field.


#. You then need to click on the indicator you wish to set a target for, to make sure it is only showing the performance data for that indicator in the graph below.


#. At this stage, two boxes should appear below the table beneath the heading, “Set Target and Thresholds”


#. You can then use the two boxes to input your indicator target and/or threshold

Note: The tool will automatically pick up whether ‘good’ performance is being above or below the target value (i.e. do you want to be above a certain limit or stay below it). If the Red/Amber Threshold value is set higher than the Target value, then the Tool will automatically know that you want your project to have metric scores below the target vale. 

`# <#-conversion-factors>`_ Conversion Factors
--------------------------------------------------

Conversion factors enable to calculate a metric from sub-metrics in a different unit e.g. 'scope 3 carbon emissions' in CO2e from the sub-metric 'non-hazardous waste' in tonnes.

To add or edit multiple conversion factors, please contact charles.naud@actionsustainability.com

`# <#-how-to-use-the-tool-\-data-approver>`_ How to use the Tool | Approver
===============================================================================

The role of an approver
-----------------------

A data approver is responsible for checking that the data submitted by the reporter is correct (sense-checking) and either approving or rejecting the report submitted. An approver will likely be responsible for approving multiple reporting packages and will have an understanding of sustainability data; therefore, they should be a sustainability professional within the project or working for the client company.

If an approver approves a report, the data then feeds into the main company’s sustainability performance. If they reject the report, the reporter must then make the required changes, before the approver can then accept the report.

Note: admin users are often also designated as approvers.

`# <#-how-to-use-the-tool--reporting-user>`_ How to use the Tool | Reporter
===============================================================================

The role of a reporter
----------------------

The main role of a reporter is to enter their company’s sustainability performance data into the tool. 

The reporter will likely be an individual within a Tier 1/2/3 supplier and will report their data via reporting packages set at pre-arranged intervals, often monthly. 

The reporter will be required to input quantitative data, against specified metrics. The reporter may also add comments and/or upload evidence documents. A reporter can only ever report data for their specified reporting package(s); they can see dashboards for their reporting package and, subject to permission, may have access to the project, supplier or client dashboards above. 

Within a project or supplier, several reporters can be assigned to multiple reporting packages. This can help to spread the reporting load across individuals within an organisation or project. Alternatively, reporting can also be automatically carried out by data collection software applications via the Sustainability Tool API. 

Once reported, the data will be approved or rejected by the Approver user and, once it is approved, will feed into the sustainability performance dashboards.

Getting setup
-------------

`# <#-tool-registration-and-log-in>`_ Tool Registration and log in
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Reporters will receive an email inviting them to join a Company account on the Sustainability Tool. They should follow the simple steps outlined in the email, which includes opening a web link (https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/accounts/register/), entering their contact details and then creating a password.

Once registered, Reporters are able to access their account by going to https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/, clicking the ‘sign in’ button in the top right-hand side of the page, and entering their newly set sign-in details.

`# <#-project-registration>`_ Project Registration
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Once the Reporter has logged in, they will land on their ‘User Dashboard’ page. They should then be able to see a list of their Company Memberships as well as the Project Reports that they have been assigned responsibility for completing. 

At this stage, the Reporter will need to accept their invitations to report on their project work packages. 

To do this, they need to navigate to the row in the ‘Company / Project Invites’ table that says their Project’s name, click on the small cogs at the end of the rows, and then select ‘accept’ for each of their invitations. 

The work package/s name/s should then appear in the ‘My Projects and Reports’ table on their dashboard.

To go into a work package, the Reporter can then simply click on the project title.

`# <#-navigation>`_ Navigation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Reporters should use the left-hand bottom menu (below the title, ‘Business Units’) to access their dashboards and reporting packages.

Please Note: There are different icons used in this menu to show the structure of a Company Project. Not all users will be able to see each level, but for reference:

•   The Stacked office icon = Business Unit Names

•   The Crossed Tools = Project Package Names

The first step to reporting is to access your Project Package. This is done simply by clicking the Project Package name in the bottom-left-hand-menu.

After selecting a package, the bottom-left-hand menu title will change from ‘Business Units’ to ‘Reporting Packages’. You can then go into your required reporting package by clicking the package name in this same menu (remember, reporting packages have the crossed tools icons

`# <#-inputting-your-performance-data>`_ Inputting your performance data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To report your data, click the ‘Reports Due’ menu option in the top-left-hand menu once you are inside the correct Reporting Package as explained above.

As a Reporter, you will then be shown a screen of all of the performance metrics that you have been assigned responsibility for assessing. 

Once you have entered all the data asked for in each metric and left your comments where possible, Reporters can simply click the ‘Submit for Approval’ button in the bottom right of the page.

Clicking this will open up a drop down option below for the Reporter, whereby they can leave an overarching comment for the data reviewer about the information they have provided, and a drop-down menu option for the Reporter to select the time period they are providing data for.

By clicking submit, the Reporter will then be presented with a pop-up to confirm they are ready to submit their data which they then simply need to approve.
